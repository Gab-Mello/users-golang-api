# Binaries for the current project
# Exclude the compiled executable, which usually takes the name of the module or main package directory.
# For example, if your main package is in a directory named 'myproject', you would add:
/myproject
# Or, if you have multiple main packages that build different executables:
/bin/
# Or, if you prefer to ignore all executables (less common for Go):
*.exe
*.bin

# Dependency management
# If using Go modules, the 'vendor/' directory contains cached dependencies.
# While some projects commit 'vendor/', it's often ignored to keep the repository smaller.
vendor/

# Editor and IDE specific files
# These files are often generated by IDEs (like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)
# and should not be committed to version control.
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.bak
*.swo

# Operating system specific files
# Files created by macOS, Windows, or other operating systems.
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Test cache
# Go's test cache can be ignored.
/go-test-cache/

# Log files and temporary files
*.log
*.tmp
